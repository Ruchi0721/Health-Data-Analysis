# Health-Data-Analysis
In this project, I  analyze and address key health-related questions based on data from OCD patients. The dataset, comprising detailed information on patient behavior, is broken down by month, gender, and obsession types. This analysis helps in identifying trends in obsessive behavior patterns and their variation across different demographics.

# Data Extraction
* The project begins with data extraction, where extract data from Kaggle.

# Data Loading
* Following data extraction, I Loaded the data in SQL Server.

# Data Transformation
* After the data was loaded in the SQL Server I performed the data transformation using SQL

* Separated data as per the requirement.
* Separated the data for different entities like Gender, Analytics data by Month, Data For Obsession Etc.
* Filled missing data using data mapping techniques.

# Data Analysis
After data cleaning I conducted data analysis in SQL to uncover meaningful insights. I analyzed following questions:

* Count & Percentage of Female vs Male that have OCD &  Average Obsession Score by Gender.
* Count of Patients by Ethnicity and their respective Average Obsession Score.
* Number of people diagnosed with OCD By Month.
* What is the most common Obsession Type (Count) & it's respective Average Obsession Score
* What is the most common Compulsion type (Count) & it's respective Average Obsession Score
